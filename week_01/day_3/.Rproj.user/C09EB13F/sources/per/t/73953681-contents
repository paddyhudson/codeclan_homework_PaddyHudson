#Qestion 1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
movies <- read_csv("data/movies.csv")
movies
```
# Initial thoughts
# Some variables could be removed: original name, ?homepage, overview, tagline
# Recode original_language to display more meaningful data
# Doesn't seem to be much missing data

#Question 2

```{r}
movies_selected <- movies %>% 
  select(title, runtime, budget)
```

#Question 3

```{r}
movies_selected %>% 
  summarise (title_na = sum(is.na(title)), 
             runtime_na = sum(is.na(runtime)), 
             budget_na = sum(is.na(budget)))
```

#Question 4

```{r}
movies_runtime <- movies_selected %>%
  mutate(runtime = na_if(runtime, "0"))
movies_runtime %>% 
summarise (title_na = sum(is.na(title)), 
             runtime_na = sum(is.na(runtime)), 
             budget_na = sum(is.na(budget)))
```
# there are now 37 missing runtime values

#Question 5


```{r}
med_runtime = median(movies_runtime$runtime, na.rm = TRUE)

movies_imputed <- movies_runtime %>% 
  mutate(runtime = coalesce(runtime, med_runtime))
  summarise (movies_imputed, runtime_na = sum(is.na(runtime)))
```
#there are now no missing values in movies_imputed

#Question 6

```{r}
movies_imputed %>% 
  slice_max(runtime, n = 10)
movies_imputed %>% 
  slice_min(runtime, n = 10)
```

#Question 7

```{r}
med_budget = median(movies_imputed$budget)
movies_imputed <- mutate(movies_imputed, budget = if_else(budget < 100, med_budget, budget))
```

#Extension 1

```{r}
movie_budgets <- movies_imputed %>% 
  mutate(budget_type = case_when(
    (budget >= 12e6 & budget < 40e6) ~ "Medium Budget",
    budget < 12e6 ~ "Small Budget",
    budget >= 40e6 ~ "Big Budget"#,
   # TRUE ~ "Medium Budget"
  ))
```

#Extension 2

```{r}
movies %>% 
  summarise(total_na = sum(is.na(across(where(is.character)))))
movies %>% 
  summarise(total_na = sum(is.na(across(where(is.numeric)))))
```
