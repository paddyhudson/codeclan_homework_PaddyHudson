#Question 1
# 18 variables, 242 observations

#Question 2
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
trimmed <- select(starbucks_drinkMenu_expanded, Beverage_category:Calories)
summarise(trimmed, count_NA_calories = sum(as.integer(is.na(Calories))))

```
#Question 3
```{r}
mutate(trimmed, calorie_diff = Calories - 135)
```
#Question 4
```{r}
trimmed_grouped <-group_by(trimmed, Beverage_category)
summarise(trimmed_grouped, avg_cals = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_cals)) %>% 
  # head(3)
  tail (3)
```
#9 categories, 3 most calorific are Smoothies, Frappuccino Blended Coffee and Signature, 3 least calorific are Coffee, Shaken Iced and Classic Espresso Drinks.

#Question5
```{r}
trimmed_grouped <-group_by(trimmed, Beverage_prep)
summarise(trimmed_grouped, avg_cals = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_cals))
```
# 13 Beverage_prep types

#Question 6
```{r}
avg_all_cals = pull(summarise(trimmed, avg_cals = mean(Calories)))
trimmed_grouped <- group_by(trimmed, Beverage_prep) %>% 
  summarise(avg_cals = mean(Calories)) %>%  
  filter(avg_cals > avg_all_cals)
  trimmed_grouped
```
#Question 7
```{r}
filter(trimmed, Beverage_category == "Coffee") %>% 
  arrange(Calories) %>% 
  head(1)
```
#Answer is a Short, with 3 calories only!
